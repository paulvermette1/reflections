When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you want to collaborate with others, or make your project available for others to use.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You might be working on the same branch as someone else and you wouldn't want their changes to clobber yours part way through your modifications

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is used when you want to get your own copy of someone else's repository on GitHub. It becomes a separate copy, similar to clone, but the copy goes into your GitHub account. I would use this instead of cloning the other person's work locally when I might want to collaborate on the forked work with others.
    Branches are deviations from your own master in a particular repository. You'd branch if you working on a change that is too complicated to just update the master and you need both versions (master and branch) to exist simultaneously.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
